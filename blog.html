<div class="card" id="blog1" style="left: 0vw;"> <span class='card__title'>Parachute Testing</span> <span class="card__category" style="background-color: blue;"> Testing</span><p class="card__content">We dropped the prototype can on 2 separate occasions, one with the 9V battery and one without it. Both were from a 9.1m high position onto a hard wooden surface. No sufficient/major damage was experienced by the can during the first drop with its weight at only around 150g. During the second weighted drop, with the can weighing about 200g, it experienced a fracture in the top part of the can and part of the friction fit for the battery was broken although the battery itself did not fall out of its designated space. Using tracking software and some basic calculations, we discovered that the final impact velocity for the second drop was 7.25m/s, which, when held in consideration with the fact that it was a hard surface, (unlike our actual drop) suggests that foam padding will not be needed.

We tested both the seams and the nylon cords that connect it to the can. We did this by applying a pull force to both to see if there was any risk of the parachute breaking off the can, or into 2 pieces during flight. They held up without issue. During our can drop tests, we also tested the parachute and its design. We noticed that it was strongly affected by side winds that caused the parachute to veer uncontrollably in the x-y plane. Since we would like to limit this, some changes will be made to the spill hole size</p></div>
<div class="card" id="blog2"  style="top: -30.63vw; right: 92vw;"> <span class='card__title'>Can Stress Testing</span> <span class="card__category" style="background-color: blue;"> Testing</span><p class="card__content">Applied a mass of 22.6kg to the can whilst it was stationary. This is equal to 221.7N of compressive force. Using Force = Change in KE/ distance, assuming the distance to be around 20cm of long grass, we have Force = (0.5 x 0.3 x 10 x 10) / 0.2 = 75N. This shows that our can’s compressive strength is definitely enough to survive the impact with minimal damage.</p></div>

<div class="card" style="top: -50vw;"><span class='card__title'>How Carbon Dioxide affects our planet</span><span class="card__category" style="background-color: green; width: 7vw;" > Environment</span><p class="card__content">Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is a greenhouse gas that significantly impacts the environment, primarily through its role in climate change. By trapping heat in the atmosphere, increased CO₂ levels from human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation contribute to global warming, leading to rising temperatures, extreme weather events, melting glaciers, and rising sea levels. It also dissolves in oceans, causing acidification that harms marine life, particularly corals and shell-building organisms. These changes disrupt ecosystems, forcing species to migrate or adapt, and contribute to biodiversity loss. Agriculture and food security are affected as shifting climate patterns and extreme weather reduce crop yields, while human health faces risks from heatwaves, respiratory issues, and the spread of diseases. Additionally, CO₂-driven warming triggers feedback loops, such as methane release from thawing permafrost, further accelerating climate change. Addressing CO₂ emissions is essential to mitigate these cascading environmental and societal impacts.</p></div>
<div class="card" style="top: -50vw;"><span class='card__title'>Second Can Prototype Printed - 07/01/25</span><span class="card__category" style="background-color: orange; width: 7vw;" > Project Update </span><p class="card__content">We have printed our second prototype can which aims to solve many of the problems of the first can by streamlining many of the rugged edges and less polished parts of our first prototype whilst also solving the issues of ventilation and strength by adding air ducts as seen in the previous post while also increasing the contact area between between print layers in many of the likely failure points of the can. As you can see by the strings we have also attached the parachute and are preparing to conduct drop tests with varying ballast weights in order to verify the structural integrity of the can through impact with the ground.</p> <br> <p class="card__content"> On our secondary mission we have continued refinining our machine learning model which is helping to define the boundary between forest and other habitats, we hope to finish this process by the end of the month! After this we plan to compare it to a set value model to compare its success against a simpler model.</p></div>

Our PCB has been expertly optimised to take up the least space possible to allow for the most room for wiring and structure within the internal cavity of our can. Now we will just have to test it and hope we don't have to re-solder every connection.</p></div>
<div class="card" style="top: -50vw;"><span class='card__title'>First Can Prototype and Circuit Breadboarding - 02/12/24</span><span class="card__category" style="background-color: orange; width: 7vw;" > Project Update </span><p class="card__content">Our first full can print which has both demonstrated the success of the design when it comes to the internal layout of components whilst pointing out a few structural flaws such as the housing for the upper bolt which has unfortunately broken by the time of this post and can be seen at the top of the second photo. This print, despite its flaws will be very useful to us in allowing us to iterate on its mistakes in order to produce a can free of flaws that fulfills all of the requirements imposed on it by both the team and the rules of the competition.</p><br><p class="card_content" style="position: relative;top: -6vw;">This is the arduino based circuit that we designed and produced in order to test both our components and code in a non-permanent and easily customizable environment. This has allowed us to iterate through prototypes for our can's software and pick up errors in the maths behind the altitude sensor that otherwise would have gone unnoticed. Additionally it has allowed us to test the capabilities of our components in a controlled environment in order to ensure that there were no faulty components that needed replacing.</p></div>
